      <description>Forget About Setting Goals. Focus on This Instead. I have always been a strong believer in setting goals to help team to focus. After reading this article and some recent experience, I realise this goal setting strategy doesnt work for all scenario. This article from James Clear really highlight some of the great point about why setting goals is not such a great idea sometimes.
Depends on the challenges that a team is facing, I think employing the systems strategy is suitable for team where they need to develop good practises or habit.</description>
